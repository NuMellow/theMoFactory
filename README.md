# The MoFactory
Welcome to the MoFactory! A project with the goal of making a real and functioning BMO from the show adventure time! The side goal in doing so is to learn as much as possible about design, electronics, project management and more. All files are open source so you can build one for yourself and/or contribute to the project too. Now with all that said, "Who wants to play video games?"

The follwing are the parts I used in the build. Since I wanted to use components I already had instead of buying everything, some things might be harder to find or
may be less efficient than other components, for example I used a power bank I had lying around instead of getting a LiPo battery which would have been lighter and
possibly take up less space.

That said, I'll try to add links to everything I used so it's easier to follow the build process:

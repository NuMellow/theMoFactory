## Bill of Materials
The follwing are the parts I used in the build. Since I wanted to use components I already had instead of buying everything, some things might be harder to find or
may be less efficient than other components, for example I used a power bacnk I had lying around instead of getting a LiPo battery which would have been lighter and
possibly take up less space.

That said, I'll try to add links to everything I used so it's easier to follow the build process:

# The MoFactory
Welcome to the MoFactory! A project with the goal of making a real and functioning BMO from the show adventure time! The side goal in doing so is to learn as much as possible about design, electronics, project management and more. All files are open source so you can build one for yourself and/or contribute to the project too. Now with all that said, "Who wants to play video games?"

## About BMO

### Hardware Specs
The heart and brain of BMO runs on a raspberry pi. Current models feature a 4inch monitor display, microphone, mini usb speaker, usb and earphone adapters and push button sensors. These are powered by a 5000mAh battery.

### Software Specs
BMO runs mostly on python and pygame. Current programs includes buttons script, games: pro football 1861 and conversation parade, with more programs and features coming soon.

### Getting started
If you would like to build one, check out the wiki and choose which version you'd like to build. The BuildingBMO page will have step-by-step instructions on how to build your own. 
Note: Versions will mostly be similar, but may have updated 3D printed parts and hardware.
